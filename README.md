# coding_friday1-



This is the public API example that I used in Coding Friday (9/9/2022)

# Once it is ran, it allows for you to send http requests to the system to change the text and color of the html div



The colors that it allows is predefined in the Flashlight Model class


Also in the week_1 directory, it has the python code for the api and requester



** also for note this will now be a repo for all weeks, but for week 1 the flashlight project in spring is apart of week 1
