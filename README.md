# Coding Friday

A weekly coding tutorial series every friday from *12:30 pm - 2:00 pm*
and *2:00 pm - 3:30 pm* in **seperate** session which are copies of eachother
As always no coding experience is required and these sessions are catered towards
individuals who are seeking to be introduced to new things.

The goal for each session is to leave with a project that you can then add to and 
improve

#### Description

This week we created an API system in Python 3 using **Flask**
the API uses a "database" internally that can be called on by another client program



Also I allowed for you all to make Requests to another API that I created in **SpringBoot**

### Week 2

![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/IntelliJ_IDE-pink.svg)




#### Description

This week we worked on creating a library loan system using **SpringBoot**
and **MySQL Workbench** as our database. This system also uses API routes for making changes.
In future installments of this program it should use maybe **Thymeleaf** or another front-end
technology to serve it as webpages for users. We also touched on some SQL concepts in writing queries



### Week 3

![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python_3-blueviolet.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/COBC-yellow.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL_Workbench-blue.svg)

![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bash_Scripting-lightblue.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/VSCode-brown.svg)





#### Description

This week we walk through performing some surface-level analysis on some NBA data acquired from Kaggle. 
The data are yearly stats for every player, every year since **1996**. We walk through parsing the CSV Data
to seperate the csv into relational tables through CSVs that can be imported into **MySQL Workbench** to allow for analysis through SQL. We then performed the analysis on the data in python using **Matplotlib** to create graphs to convey player's
career stats grouped by their draft class. We then also used **COBC**, which is a command line COBOL compiler for compiling cobol to perform analysis as well after using a python primer for the data.



### Week 5


![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java_8-blueviolet.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maven-yellow.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-blue.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/IntelliJ_IDE-grey.svg)





#### Description

This week we use **Java** with **Maven dependencies** to create a music playlist bot that allows for you to issue commands as such
*"!play 24k magic bruno mars"* and the bot will search youtube for the song and add it enqueue to be played in order through **Discord**. 
This essentially creates a joint playlist among the discord server allowing for multiple users to listen to and interact with the playlist



### Week 6


![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python_3-blueviolet.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flask-yellow.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/MathPlotLib-blue.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Numpy-red.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/VSCode-green.svg)




#### Description

To celebrate BMEN week for this week we are creating a simple **Flask** app using **Python3** that will allow for users
to fill out a form that will then return back to them their current blood pressure status. It will then add it to a csv file that can then be used by an analysis python script to generate a graph of all users in the csv.


### Week 7
