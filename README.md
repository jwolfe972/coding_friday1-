#### Description

This week we created an API system in Python 3 using **Flask**
the API uses a "database" internally that can be called on by another client program



Also I allowed for you all to make Requests to another API that I created in **SpringBoot**

#### Description

This week we worked on creating a library loan system using **SpringBoot**
and **MySQL Workbench** as our database. This system also uses API routes for making changes.
In future installments of this program it should use maybe **Thymeleaf** or another front-end
technology to serve it as webpages for users. We also touched on some SQL concepts in writing queries



### Week 3


No coding friday this week :(
