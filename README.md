# Coding Friday

A weekly coding tutorial series every friday from *12:30 pm - 2:00 pm*
and *2:00 pm - 3:30 pm* in **seperate** session which are copies of eachother
As always no coding experience is required and these sessions are catered towards
individuals who are seeking to be introduced to new things.

The goal for each session is to leave with a project that you can then add to and 
improve


### Week 1

#### Description

This week we created an API system in Python 3 using **Flask**
the API uses a "database" internally that can be called on by another client program



Also I allowed for you all to make Requests to another API that I created in **SpringBoot**

### Week 2

![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu-red.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/IntelliJ_IDE-pink.svg)




#### Description

This week we worked on creating a library loan system using **SpringBoot**
and **MySQL Workbench** as our database. This system also uses API routes for making changes.
In future installments of this program it should use maybe **Thymeleaf** or another front-end
technology to serve it as webpages for users. We also touched on some SQL concepts in writing queries



### Week 3

![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rest-blueviolet.svg)

### Week 4


![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python_3-blueviolet.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/COBC-yellow.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL_Workbench-blue.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-green.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu-red.svg)

![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bash_Scripting-lightblue.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/VSCode-brown.svg)





#### Description

This week we walk through performing some surface-level analysis on some NBA data acquired from Kaggle. 
The data are yearly stats for every player, every year since **1996**. We walk through parsing the CSV Data
to seperate the csv into relational tables through CSVs that can be imported into **MySQL Workbench** to allow for analysis through SQL. We then performed the analysis on the data in python using **Matplotlib** to create graphs to convey player's
career stats grouped by their draft class. We then also used **COBC**, which is a command line COBOL compiler for compiling cobol to perform analysis as well after using a python primer for the data.



### Week 5


![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java_8-blueviolet.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maven-yellow.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-blue.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/IntelliJ_IDE-grey.svg)





#### Description

This week we use **Java** with **Maven dependencies** to create a music playlist bot that allows for you to issue commands as such
*"!play 24k magic bruno mars"* and the bot will search youtube for the song and add it enqueue to be played in order through **Discord**. 
This essentially creates a joint playlist among the discord server allowing for multiple users to listen to and interact with the playlist



### Week 6


![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python_3-blueviolet.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flask-yellow.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/MathPlotLib-blue.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Numpy-red.svg)
![Python ](https://img.shields.io/badge/VSCode-green.svg)




#### Description

To celebrate BMEN week for this week we are creating a simple **Flask** app using **Python3** that will allow for users
to fill out a form that will then return back to them their current blood pressure status. It will then add it to a csv file that can then be used by an analysis python script to generate a graph of all users in the csv.


### Week 7

**REPORTING**, **REPORTING**, **REPORTING**

In this week of coding Friday I will be using the throwback csv data from the week 4 csv python parsing
tutorial, plug it into Power BI and create a dashboard for reporting key averages for players


For this week all you will need is Power BI Desktop *can receive a free license using your UNT email address*
and also the **players.csv** and the **player_stats_info.csv** files which are located in the week 8 directory


I look forward to seeing you all and teach you some of the Power BI basics I know



##### Demo Dashboard that we will create:

It is getting closer and closer to exam times for all of us.. Wouldn't it be cool to
have our own program to generate quizzes based on the questions we give?

Well today that's what we will be creating.

We will be using Java Spring and MongoDB as our DB (NoSQL DB) to allow for more flexible
binding of our data!!

#### Description

For the coding friday this week,
I have decided that I want you guys to go out and create things on your own based on the learnings from this semester

It could be anything, as long as you are grasping these concepts and enjoying the creation process..


Also would be cool to go out and rent a cloud DB from Aws, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.
and to experiment with it and other services the cloud platform has to offer!!


Please Email me: jordanwolfe2@my.untdallas.edu if you would like any recommendations for a project
or any advice!

I enjoyed running Coding Friday this semester!
